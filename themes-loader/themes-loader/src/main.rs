/**
* The Themes Loader is supposed to save a .json file with a lot of the themes from jetbrains and
* vs code
*
* this is to not overload their api / rate limit ourselves and just load the data from storage
* this also probably makes things a lot faster and easier since i can just load from a json file on
* each new theme I want to get
*
* this is also my first time trying rust
