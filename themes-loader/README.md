# Themes Loader

# miau
The Themes Loader is supposed to save a .json file with a lot of the themes from jetbrains and
vs code

# why
this is to not overload their api / rate limit ourselves and just load the data from storage
this also probably makes things a lot faster and easier since i can just load from a json file on
each new theme I want to get

# side note
this is also my first time trying rust
